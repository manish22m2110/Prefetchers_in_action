# Using ChampSim

ChampSim is the result of academic research. To support its continued growth, please cite our work when you publish results that use ChampSim by clicking "Cite this Repository" in the sidebar.

# Compile

ChampSim takes a JSON configuration script. Examine `champsim_config.json` for a fully-specified example. All options described in this file are optional and will be replaced with defaults if not specified. The configuration scrip can also be run without input, in which case an empty file is assumed.
```
$ ./config.sh <configuration file>
$ make
```

# Run simulation

Execute the binary directly.
```
$ bin/champsim --warmup_instructions 200000000 --simulation_instructions 500000000 ~/path/to/traces/600.perlbench_s-210B.champsimtrace.xz
```

The number of warmup and simulation instructions given will be the number of instructions retired. Note that the statistics printed at the end of the simulation include only the simulation phase.
## Project Overview

This section details the implementation of advanced cache performance optimization techniques using ChampSim as part of the CS 683: Advanced Computer Architecture course under the guidance of Prof. Biswabandan Panda.

### Techniques Implemented

- **IP-Stride Prefetcher:** Implemented an IP-stride prefetcher to detect memory access patterns, thereby improving cache hits.
- **Feedback-Directed Stream Prefetcher:** Developed a feedback-directed stream prefetcher that adapts to the workload dynamically.
- **Adaptive Prefetch Throttling:** Incorporated adaptive prefetch throttling to optimize the balance between aggressive prefetching and cache pollution.

These enhancements were tested extensively within the ChampSim framework, demonstrating significant improvements in cache efficiency over the baseline.

# Add your own branch predictor, data prefetchers, and replacement policy
**Copy an empty template**
```
$ mkdir prefetcher/mypref
$ cp prefetcher/no_l2c/no.cc prefetcher/mypref/mypref.cc
```

**Work on your algorithms with your favorite text editor**
```
$ vim prefetcher/mypref/mypref.cc
```

**Compile and test**
Add your prefetcher to the configuration file.
```
{
    "L2C": {
        "prefetcher": "mypref"
    }
}
```
Note that the example prefetcher is an L2 prefetcher. You might design a prefetcher for a different level.

```
$ ./config.sh <configuration file>
$ make
$ bin/champsim --warmup_instructions 200000000 --simulation_instructions 500000000 600.perlbench_s-210B.champsimtrace.xz
```

# Evaluate Simulation

ChampSim measures the IPC (Instruction Per Cycle) value as a performance metric. <br>
There are some other useful metrics printed out at the end of simulation. <br>

Good luck and be a champion! <br>
